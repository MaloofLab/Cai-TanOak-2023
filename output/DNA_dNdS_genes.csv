Binds W-box sequences  in vitro. Forms protein complexes with itself and with WRKY40 and WRKY60. Coexpression with WRKY18 or WRKY60 made plants more susceptible to both P. syringae and B. cinerea. WRKY18, WRKY40, and WRKY60 have partially redundant roles in response to the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, with WRKY18 playing a more important role than the other two. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.",WRKY DNA-binding protein 40;(source:Araport11)
