One gene that comes up from the diplotype analysis is maker-72357_pilon-snap-gene-1.15, which has homology to an Arabidospis NBS-ARC LRR.  I'd like to do a sequence alignment of this gene and all of its variants to figure out what is going on...

First, let's get the interpro annotation for this gene

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostrings)
```

```{r}
target <- "maker-72357_pilon-snap-gene-1.15"
```


```{r}
interpro <- read_tsv("../output/12_21_tanoak_interpro.tsv.gz", col_names = FALSE)
head(interpro)
```

```{r}
interpro %>%
  filter(str_detect(X1, target),
         !is.na(X13)) 
```

Let's also do a blast.  First get the sequence:

```{r}
prots <- readAAStringSet("../input/blast/TanOak.proteins.fa")

as.character(prots[str_detect(names(prots),target)])

```
